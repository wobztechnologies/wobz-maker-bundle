        entity:
#            TODO: add your own entities here in your services.yaml for your project
            - Order:
                fqcn: Class to your entity/model
                enum:
                    fqcn: Class path to your enum
                    method: your method
```

**The enum have to be like this:**
```php
enum BatchStatusEnum: string
{
 // Here it'static an enum with static values and with no method.static
 // In this case , you can delete method key in enum yaml configuration
    case PLACE = "Place";
}
```
or:
```php
enum OrderStatusEnum: string
{
    case PLACE = "place";
        
    // In the yaml, you will have to add the method key "getTraduction"
    public function getTraduction(): string
    {
        return match ($this) {
            self::PLACE => "Status",
        };
    }
}
```
